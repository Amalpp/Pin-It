## Rejex

The present module is meant to embed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) into a NodeJS application.<br>
During installation, the specific JRE platform will be downloaded from Oracle and no further JRE installation
steps will be required. In this way it is possible to call and execute a specific pre-compiled Java class from a NodeJS application.

### Install
```bash
$ npm install --save rejex
```
